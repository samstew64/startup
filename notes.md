After updating the IP address of the server to a static IP, the server does not show the CS 260 Web Programming website, only the Caddy default one.  After talking with a TA, neither of us were able to solve this problem.  On the bright side, I got HTTPS working somehow.  I didn't know Caddy could setup automatic certificates (I'm used to apache2) and so that was really cool to see.
